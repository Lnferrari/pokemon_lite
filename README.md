# Pokemon Championship

### Project to present at the end of the 'Programming Basics' module.

#### Without any knowledge of DOM manipulation yet, and looking forward to get that knowledge to give it a desired graphical interface to complete the project as I wish, I have recreated a pokemon battle tournament. This tournament includes the option of choosing how many participants you want to participate in there.
#### The process of choosing the participants occurs randomly, by searching through the list of previously created pokemon. The attacks learned by each pokemon have been previously created and assigned according to their type (electric, fire, grass, water).
#### When it comes to generating the crosses of the tournament, it is done in a random way as well as the choice of the attack to be performed by the pokemon during the battle, having a 66.6% chance of performing it and a 33.3% chance of missing it.
